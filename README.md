# Titanic Dataset EDA Project

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, which includes information on the passengers of the RMS Titanic. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival rates. Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we examine various passenger attributes, such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare, to see how these factors correlate with survival outcomes.

## Project Objectives
- Understand the distribution of key features in the Titanic dataset (e.g., Age, Gender, Pclass).
- Analyze survival rates across different passenger groups and identify patterns.
- Use data visualization techniques to display insights and make the findings easier to interpret.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is a well-known dataset from [Kaggleâ€™s Titanic Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), consisting of 891 entries with details on each passenger.

## Key Insights
- Survival chances varied significantly based on factors such as gender, age, and socio-economic status.
- Passengers in first class and women had higher survival rates compared to others.

## Project Structure
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and transforming data where necessary.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and analyzing different variables in relation to survival rates.
- **Conclusions**: Summarizing key findings and their potential implications.
